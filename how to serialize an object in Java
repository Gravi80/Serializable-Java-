Step 1: Get the object to serialize [can be null]. Let the object be o.
Step 2: Get a valid ObectOutputStream instance. Let the ObjectOutputStream instance be out.
Step 3: out.writeObject(o); will serialize the object to the stream.

String s = new String(); //the object that we will serialize
ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(“out.dat”));
out.writeObject(s); //serialize the object



 If there any members in a Serializable class, then the following guidelines apply:

     i. If they are primitives, they are automatically serializable.

    ii. If they are non-primitive objects, they must implement Serializable.
       If we try to serialize an object that contains reference to an object that does not implement Serializable
       then while serializing the object, we get a Runtime Exception.

    iii. If we have a reference to a non-serializable object in our class,
         then we have to mark the reference with the keyword transient.
         The transient keyword on a reference means that when the parent object is serialized
         then the object whose reference is marked as transient will not be serialized.
